#KinectSkeltrackGestures  
This project develops gesture recognizer on top of [Skeltrack](https://github.com/joaquimrocha/Skeltrack). Specifically, it uses Skeltrack to extract coordinates of joints and uses them to recognize gestures.

#TODO  
* Accessing joint coordinates using Skeltrack.  
* Using rule/heuristic based approach to identify gesture without any training.
